# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis


## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Uses multiple linear regression to properly analyze which variables in the given dataset will accurately predict a model's MPG.

* Q1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- A1. Using the given MechaCar_mpg dataset to determine the statistical variance in vehicle_weight and ground_clearance make it unlikely to be inefficent in accurately assessing MPG.

* Q2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- A2. The slope is statistcally significant in that the intercept is less than .05 and greater than 0. The intercept shows variability in the dependent variable, while the independent varaibles are all amounting to zero.

* Q3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- A3. The Multiple R-Squared value is equal to 0.7149033 or 0.7149. As this value is between 0 and 1, it can be used to indicate that the model is efficient in predicting MPG.
